         <h2 class='about'>About</h2>
         <h3>Project inspiration</h3>
         <div class="col-count">
            <p class="indent">It all began during my service year, where I observed my place of primary assignment, at a local secondary school, Burutu local government, Delta State, Nigeria. I felt the exuberance exhibited by few of these student to study, but were faced with the challenges of inadequate facilities. it has since then ingrained in me to help solve these problem, but there isn't much i could do, however the spur to be a solution provider not only for the students, but to my generation at large kept hitting me harder by the day, hours turn to hours, days to weeks, weeks into months, soon my service year had come to an end, with nothing to show for all the emotional momentum i garnered.
            <p class="indent">But this temporary failure is not enough to let go of my pursuit to providing solutions to impending and proposed problems in the nearest future, few weeks later, I had left the place of primary assignment, I pondered in my mind why I was unable to profer solution to those in need, with so much troubles in my heart, I visited the nearest bookshop to get a book on leadership, <q class="quote">21 irrefutable laws of a leader.</q> recomended by a friend who was a medical student at the time, there I realized i couldn't be a solution provider if I do not have anything of value to offer. I was able to answer the difficult question why I was unable to solve the student's problems back then.
            <p class="indent"> This led me to begin examining the lives of great leader around the world, people who are providing solutions, making the world go merry, i figured out that a good number of them were software engineers, I looked up at the profession, know what it is about, right there I knew this is meant for me.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
               I began the tech journey, there were huddles to jump, some concepts were had to get, some were easy, the journey has not been rocket science, but we here, taking a step at a time, making each day count.
            
            <strong>  
            There is a saying: <q class="quote"> if you want to keep anything away from a black man, put it in black and white. </q> </strong> While this saying is true for a typical black man, I am convinced there are a good number of people who desire information, but were curtailed to these desired information, such as building wealth, investing, politics, leadership and science to mention a few genre, this project is designed to bridge that gap.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">With this project, they can scrutinize books they aspire to acquire cognition from, by borrowing the resources and skim them within the confines of their comfort, however the limitation could be the cost of getting smart phone or access to the internet.
            </p>
            
            <p class="indent">
               Hence, this has begat the motivation for building a library application which can help future leaders or anyone with the zest to access information with hampered reources available to them in their locale.
